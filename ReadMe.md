### Game's Name & Description
 #### Kitty Fall 

😺 Cozy Adventure with Ginger the Orange Cat!

Kitty Fall is a charming, retro-style arcade game built with the HTML Canvas API. It puts a cozy spin on the classic "flappy" genre, where the player guides Ginger the brave and grumpy orange cat through an endless vibrant sunflower field.

The core objective is simple: jump to keep Ginger flying, navigating the gaps between the obstacles (pipes) to score as many points as possible.

#### Why Kitty Fall?

The inspiration behind Kitty Fall was to create a game that offered the addictive challenge of a classic mobile arcade title, but wrapped in a visually warm, autumnal, and cozy package. By incorporating pixel art and a gradual difficulty curve (the game speeds up as the score increases), it provides a satisfying test of reflexes and timing.
